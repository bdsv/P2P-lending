This program downloads the historic loan data of the platform Bondora, scores them using machine learning and invest in the most attractive.  

DISCLAIMER: THIS CODE COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE AUTHOR DOES NOT ENCOURAGE TO USE IT WITH REAL MONEY (ACTUALLY I RECOMMEND AGAINST IT). DO NOT INVEST WHAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE. REAL MONEY (100â‚¬) HAS BEEN USED EXCLUSIVELY AS A VALIDATION STEP AND NEVER AS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO FOLLOW THIS METHOD. I HAVE NO AFFILIATION WITH BONDORA OTHER THAN BEING A CLIENT. It is considered as an interesting mathematical and programming exercise, and I encourage the reader to view it strictly as it. I do not encourage anybody to use this system with real money, and if you decide to do so, do it at your own risk.
